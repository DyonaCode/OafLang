# Oaf Documentation

This folder contains the actively maintained project documentation for the current compiler/runtime implementation.

## Documentation Map

- `LanguageSpecification.md`
  Canonical language specification for the currently implemented syntax and semantics.
- `guides/`
  Step-by-step programming guides for writing and running Oaf programs.
- `reference/`
  API-style reference docs for CLI commands, runtime modules, and standard library modules.
- `../examples/`
  Runnable example programs, tutorials, and sample applications.
- `../benchmarks/`
  Cross-language benchmark kernels and comparison scripts (C and Rust).

## Existing Design Specs

The original design and architecture specs are kept at repository root:

- `SpecOverview.md`
- `SpecSyntax.md`
- `SpecRuntime.md`
- `SpecFileStructure.md`
- `SpecRoadmap.md`

These remain useful for long-term direction, while docs in this folder are implementation-focused and kept aligned with passing tests.
